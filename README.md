# StackImplementation
 This will include a Stack fully custom by me to show case how a stack works.

A stack is a linear data structure
Follows the LIFO approach, last in first out.
Push - Puts element on top of the stack.
Pop - Removes element from top of the stack.
Peek - Geths the element from top of the stack.
To check if full - Top must be equal to Max - 1 (since Array starts from 0 index)
To check if empty - Top must be equal to -1

Time complexity is 0(1).
